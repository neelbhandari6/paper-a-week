# paper-a-week
This repository is a personal project, where I aim to read and disseminate one paper a week. For now, the papers on this repo will be focussed on Natural language Processing, but I will occasionally be exploring other fields. 
I am always open to suggestions on papers to cover, and hope this can help form a good framework for individuals to explore the field of NLP, but also provide a lower barrier of access to understanding papers as well.
